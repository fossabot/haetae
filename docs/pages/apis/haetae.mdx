## Installation

<br/>

<PkgManagerTabs>
  <>
    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev haetae
    ```
  </>
  <>
    ```bash
    yarn add --dev haetae
    ```
  </>
  <>
    ```bash
    pnpm add --save-dev haetae
    ```
  </>
</PkgManagerTabs>

## Usage

The package `haetae` exports other `@haetae/*` packages all at once. <br/>
It's source code is _roughly_ like the snippet below.

```ts
export * as core from '@haetae/core'
export * as utils from '@haetae/utils'
export * as js from '@haetae/javascript'
export * as git from '@haetae/git'
export * as cli from '@haetae/cli'
export const pkg = { /* ... */ }
```

So you probably use `haetae` on the config file like this.

**haetae.config.js**:

```js
const { core, utils, js, git, cli, pkg  } = require('haetae')

module.exports = core.configure({
  // Other options are ommitted for brevity.
  commands: {
    // ...
  },
})
```

## CLI

`haetae` also exports `cli` as API.
However, you probably don't need it.
Because, in general, the CLI features are to be used as CLI, not as API.
`haetae` is a CLI by itself, providing exactly same features of `@haetae/cli`.
**For detailed usage as CLI, refer to [`@haetae/cli`](./haetae-cli).**
