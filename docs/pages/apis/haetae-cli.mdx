## Installation

<Callout>
  **Are you developing a library(e.g. plugin) for Haetae?** <br />
  It might be more suitable to specify `@haetae/cli` as `peerDependencies` than `dependencies`.
</Callout>

### To automatically install `@haetae/cli` and its `peerDependencies`

You may want to install `@haetae/cli` and its `peerDependencies` all at once. <br/>
[`install-peerdeps`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/install-peerdeps) is a good tool for that.

<br/>

<PkgManagerTabs>
  <>
    ```bash
    # As dependencies
    npx install-peerdeps @haetae/cli
    # As devDependencies
    npx install-peerdeps --dev @haetae/cli
    ```
  </>
  <>
    ```bash
    # As dependencies
    npx install-peerdeps --yarn @haetae/cli
    # As devDependencies
    npx install-peerdeps --yarn --dev @haetae/cli
    ```
  </>
  <>
    ```bash
    # As dependencies
    npx install-peerdeps --pnpm @haetae/cli
    # As devDependencies
    npx install-peerdeps --pnpm --dev @haetae/cli
    ```
  </>
</PkgManagerTabs>

### To manually handle installation

You might want to manually deal with installation.<br/>
First, install `@haetae/cli` itself.

<br/>

<PkgManagerTabs>
  <>
    ```bash
    # As dependencies
    npm install @haetae/cli
    # As devDependencies
    npm install --save-dev @haetae/cli
    ```
  </>
  <>
    ```bash
    # As dependencies
    yarn add @haetae/cli
    # As devDependencies
    yarn add --dev @haetae/cli
    ```
  </>
  <>
    ```bash
    # As dependencies
    pnpm add @haetae/cli
    # As devDependencies
    pnpm add --save-dev @haetae/cli
    ```
  </>
</PkgManagerTabs>

Then, check out `peerDependencies` and manually handle them.<br/>
(e.g. Install them as `dependencies` or set them as `peerDependencies`)

```bash
# This does not install, but just show peerDependencies.
npm info @haetae/cli peerDependencies
```
